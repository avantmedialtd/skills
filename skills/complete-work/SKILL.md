# Complete Work

Close out a finished unit of work: archive the OpenSpec change, commit with trailers, transition the Jira issue to Done, push, and verify CI.

## When to use

- All tasks in an active OpenSpec change are implemented and tested.
- The user says "complete work", "wrap up", "finish this one", or names a change to close out.
- Work needs to land on `main`/`master` with a clean audit trail.

## Steps

1. Find the active OpenSpec change in `openspec/changes/`. If multiple exist, ask the user which change to complete.
2. Read the proposal (`openspec/changes/<id>/proposal.md`) to extract the issue key (look for a Jira key pattern like `PROJ-123` in the metadata or body) and the title.
3. **If an issue key was found:** Fetch the issue details using `af jira get <issue-key>` to verify it exists and get the summary. **If no issue key was found:** Skip all Jira operations (steps 3, 6) and omit the `Issue=` trailer in step 5.
4. **Archive the OpenSpec change (if not already archived):**
   - Check if `openspec/changes/<id>/` directory exists
   - If it exists, invoke `/opsx:archive` (Skill tool) with the `<change-id>`
   - If the directory does not exist (already archived), skip this step
5. Commit with trailers:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "<summary>" \
     [--trailer "Issue=<issue-key>"] \
     --trailer "OpenSpec-Id=<change-id>"
   ```
   Where `<summary>` is derived from the Jira issue (if available) or from the OpenSpec proposal title. Only include the `--trailer "Issue=<issue-key>"` flag when an issue key is present.
6. **If an issue key was found:** Transition the issue to "Done" using `af jira transition <issue-key> --to "Done"`. If this fails, run `af jira transitions <issue-key>` to find the correct completion status name. **If no issue key:** Skip this step.
7. Push to remote: `git push`

## CI Verification

8. Read the Jenkins job path from the project's CLAUDE.md (e.g., `Jenkins job: folder/pipeline-name`). If not configured, skip this phase. The full job path includes the current branch: `<job-path>/<branch>`.

9. Wait ~30 seconds for Jenkins to pick up the push, then poll build status:
   ```bash
   af jenkins build <job-path>/<branch> --json
   ```
   Repeat every 30 seconds until the build is no longer in progress (check the `building` field or `result` field in JSON output).

10. **If build succeeds**: Done.

11. **If build fails**:
    - Run `af jenkins stages <job-path>/<branch>` to identify the failing stage
    - Run `af jenkins stage-log <job-path>/<branch> <failing-stage>` to read the error output
    - Fix the code based on the failure
    - Commit the fix using the same `git add -A && git commit -m "<summary>" --trailer ...` pattern from step 5, push, and poll again

    **Escape valve**: If the build still fails after **3 CI attempts**, **STOP** and report the failing stage, error output, and what fixes were attempted.
