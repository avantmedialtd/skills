This is a skills repository. Each directory under `skills/` contains a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (name, description) and markdown instructions.

When editing skills:

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Put supplementary content in `references/` with clear pointers from SKILL.md
- Descriptions should be specific about when to trigger — err on the side of "pushy"
